/**
 * <p>Interface describing a collection of Valves that should be executed
 * in sequence when the <code>invoke()</code> method is invoked.  It is
 * required that a Valve somewhere in the pipeline (usually the last one)
 * must process the request and create the corresponding response, rather
 * than trying to pass the request on.</p>
 *
 * <p>There is generally a single Pipeline instance associated with each
 * Container.  The container's normal request processing functionality is
 * generally encapsulated in a container-specific Valve, which should always
 * be executed at the end of a pipeline.  To facilitate this, the
 * <code>setBasic()</code> method is provided to set the Valve instance that
 * will always be executed last.  Other Valves will be executed in the order
 * that they were added, before the basic Valve is executed.</p>

 * Tomcat通过一层层的父子容器最终找到某个Servlet来处理请求，但是并不是只有Servlet才会处理请求，实际上这个查找路径上的父子容器都会对请求做一些处理
 *
 * Pipeline-Valve 组成的一个责任链模式，完成调用链
 *
 * 每个容器都有一个Pipeline对象，只要触发这个 Pipeline 的第一个 Valve，这个容器里 Pipeline 中的 Valve 就都会被调用到
 *
 * 不同容器的Pipeline如何链式触发？ Pipeline 中还有个 getBasic 方法。这个 BasicValve 处于 Valve 链表的末端，它是 Pipeline 中必不可少的一个 Valve，负责调用下层容器的 Pipeline 里的第一个 Valve
 * @see http://images.coderandyli.com/tomcat08.jpg
 *
 * Wrapper ({@link org.apache.catalina.core.StandardWrapper})容器的最后一个 Valve ({@link org.apache.catalina.core.StandardWrapperValve#invoke(Request, Response)})会创建一个 Filter 链，并调用 doFilter 方法，最终会调到 Servlet 的 {@link javax.servlet.Servlet#service(ServletRequest, ServletResponse)} 方法
